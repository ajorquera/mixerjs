Web server that **serves multiple JavaScript libraries in a single http request.**
During web development, a project will need the use of different kind of libraries. It can be
frameworks, plugins or tracking scripts. Some websites load these dependencies one http request at a time. This means that,
as dependencies grows, it creates an overhead on the performance of the website. To handle this, there are some continuous
integration tools for unifying and minifying files. But, theses tools take time and knowledge to make proper use of
them. Hopefully MixerJS will provide a easy solution.


The basic use will be:

- http://hostname/filename.js?libraryA&libraryB

- http://hostname/mixer.js?libraryA=versionA&libraryB


## Installation

To run mixerJS, you will need to install nodejs. Go to [their website](https://nodejs.org) for further instructions. Once installed, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## How It Works
Mixerjs uses [bower](http://bower.io/) for fetching the necessary libraries and does some underneath logic to handle
library dependency and errors. It uses different tools for minifying, concatenating and making custom builds.

## Configuration File
MixerJs will have by default some basic configuration.

**config.json**

```JSON
{
    "env"    : "develop",
    "port"   : 8080
}
```

## Features

+ #### Minifying

 Minifying the libraries can be optional. Adding .min.js to the end of the filename will minify it
 automatically.

+ #### Cache and nginx

 For better use of MixerJS, we can take advantage of nginx cache. Nginx cache is very fast, with either memcache
 or disk storage. The first attempt to retrieve the file will go through nginx and it will be proxied to mixerJS.
 Subsequent attempts will be serve by nginx's cache.

+ #### Library Fallback

 Some libraries doesn't follow the correct pattern when setting up their bower.json, as a consequence, mixerjs has
 problems to find the corresponding library file. `libraryFallback.json` is a json file that solves this issue,
 setting the correct bower properties for each library.

```JSON
{
    "jquery-easing-original": {
        "default": {
            "main":"jquery.easing.js"
        },

        "1.3.2": {
            "main":"jquery.easing.js"
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

 MixerJS have some test you can run by using [mocha](http://mochajs.org/). To run the tests with mocha installed go
 to the terminal and do:

 `npm test`
